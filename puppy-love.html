    <h1>My Puppy Love</h1>
    <p>I fell in love, deeply in love when i first saw this adorable ball of fur. He looked very defenseless as he was
        just afew days old.The eyes gave the true definition of adorable. My puppy fell in love as well (or so i
        believed), i couldn't go anywhere without the constant companion in the puppy.</p>
